### Email 1 Welcome and Lead Magnet Delivery

**Subject:** Your free Moonshot Checklist is inside (and it’s totally not a PDF)

**Body:**
Hey there,

Welcome to the inner circle. Your free **Moonshot Checklist** is attached to this email in spirit and as a downloadable PDF that looks very official. It contains five secrets exchanges don’t want you to know, including the one about reading fees.

Start with Step 1: rename your demo account to something aspirational (we recommend **Lambo Fund**). That small act signals commitment and makes screenshots look better.

Inside you’ll also find a tiny quiz that tells you you’re already a trader. Complete it to unlock your **Paper Hands Pro** badge (a static PNG with maximum confidence).

See you on the other side of the moon,

### Email 2 Primer on Hype and a Fast Win

**Subject:** How FOMO sounds like a TED Talk — plus a 3-minute win

**Body:**
Hello again,

Most courses start with a manifesto. We start with a fast win. Watch the 3-minute primer on **FOMO as Motivational Speaking** and post your takeaway in the community thread titled **“Wins of the Week”**. The first five posts get a confetti GIF and a virtual high-five.

This lesson is short because attention spans are short and so are many market cycles. You’ll learn one practical trick: how to spot a scarcity banner that’s actually just a marketing intern with a timer.

Keep the momentum,
Crypto QuickRich Academy Team

### Email 3 Tools, Tinsel, and a Little Truth

**Subject:** Wallets, exchanges, and why logos matter more than you think

**Body:**
Quick note,

Choosing a wallet is 70% security, 30% aesthetics. We cover both in today’s mini-lesson **Wallets and Wizards**. Spoiler: shiny logos increase confidence and decrease reading of terms.

Action item: create a demo account and post a screenshot named **“My Lambo Fund”** in the community. We’ll award the first 10 with a badge and a gentle reminder to actually read the fees.

Also included: a short checklist for avoiding obvious scams and a tongue-in-cheek glossary (e.g., **HODL**: Hold On for Dear Likes).

Onward,
Crypto QuickRich Academy Team

### Email 4 Webinar Invite and Social Proof Theater

**Subject:** Live Webinar Tonight — How I Turned $50 into a Story

**Body:**
Heads up,

Tonight at 7 PM we’re hosting a live webinar: **How I Turned $50 into a Story**. Expect authority, urgency, and at least one staged testimonial. We’ll show you how to build a webinar that sells the course about selling the course.

Why attend: you’ll see the funnel in action, hear three “real” success stories, and get access to a limited-time bonus pack (countdown timer included). Seats are limited because scarcity is a feature, not a bug.

Bring a notebook or a sense of irony. Either will do.

**Subject:** Enrollment is open — pick your plan before the moon phases change

### Email 6 Cart Close Urgency and Refund Theater

**Subject:** Doors close soon — or when the market corrects, whichever comes first

**Body:**
Final reminder,

Doors close in 12 hours. This is not a drill. This is a countdown. This is also a gentle theatrical device used to create urgency.

Remember our 14-Day Satire Guarantee: if you don’t laugh, learn one persuasion trick, or craft a decent meme within 14 days, we’ll refund you—provided you submit a 200-word explanation and a haiku about candlesticks.

If you’re on the fence, think of this as an educational purchase with a side of performance art. If you’re already in, welcome to the funnel that funnels funnels.

Warmly,
Crypto QuickRich Academy Team

**CTA:** Enroll before doors close

### Email 7 Last Chance and Alumni Upsell

**Subject:** Last chance to enroll — alumni mastermind seats available for people who like paying more

**Body:**
This is it,

Enrollment is officially closed. If you missed it, we have one consolation: the alumni **Mastermind** opens soon for those who want to pay more to learn how to pay less. It includes live Q&A, private group access, and the satisfaction of knowing you’re in an exclusive club.

For those inside: start Module 0 now, claim your badge, and post your first meme. For those outside: sign up for the waitlist and we’ll send you a free checklist titled **Moonwalk or Moonshot** to soothe the sting.

Thank you for laughing with us and learning with us. If you enjoyed the satire, consider donating to a financial literacy program. If you didn’t, write that haiku and we’ll read it aloud at graduation.

See you at the moon,
Crypto QuickRich Academy Team

**CTA:** Join the Mastermind waitlist
