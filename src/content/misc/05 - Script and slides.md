### Module 1 The Hype Primer Lesson Script and Slides

#### Objective

Expose scarcity, urgency, and FOMO mechanics by imitating them and then explaining them.

#### Spoken Script

“Lesson one: FOMO is just a TED Talk with a countdown timer. If you’ve ever bought something because a banner said ‘Only 9 spots left,’ congratulations — you have been marketed to. Today we’ll build a scarcity banner and then immediately explain why it works. Step one: make it urgent. Step two: make it feel exclusive. Step three: apologize later.”

#### Sample Slide 2

**Title**: FOMO and Scarcity
**Bullets**: Why countdowns work; How scarcity feels like status; The apology script

#### Slide Notes and Joke Prompts

- Exact joke: “Scarcity is the marketing equivalent of whispering ‘limited edition’ while holding a flashlight under your chin.”
- Exercise prompt: “Write a scarcity line that sounds urgent but is legally vague. Example: ‘Offer ends when the moon phases change.’”

### Module 2 Tools and the Tinsel Lesson Script and Slides

#### Objective

Mock the fetishization of tools and logos while giving a tiny bit of practical guidance about fees and security.

#### Spoken Script

“People pick wallets the way they pick phones: mostly by color and logo. Today we’ll name wallets, admire logos, and read one sentence of the terms of service out loud for comedic relief. Then we’ll cover one real thing: fees. Fees are the part of the market that eats your lunch quietly and then leaves a polite note.”

#### Sample Slide 3

**Title**: Wallets Logos and Fees
**Bullets**: Pick a wallet; Read one sentence of the TOS; Check fees before you screenshot

#### Slide Notes and Joke Prompts

- Exact joke: “If your wallet logo looks like a sports car, you will feel richer even if your balance is a receipt.”
- Practical aside: include one clear line: **Always check withdrawal fees**.

### Module 3 Binary Options for the Bold Lesson Script and Slides

#### Objective

Satirize binary options as pure bet framing and teach students to recognize betting language disguised as trading.

#### Spoken Script

“Binary options are the financial world’s version of flipping a coin and then writing a blog post about your intuition. We’ll role-play a sales call where you pitch a binary option using only weather metaphors. If you can sell a rain forecast as a ‘market insight,’ congratulations — you’ve learned the art of confident guessing.”

#### Sample Slide 4

**Title**: Binary Options and Betting Language
**Bullets**: Heads or tails with charts; How language turns bets into ‘strategies’; Role-play script

#### Slide Notes and Joke Prompts

- Exact joke: “Binary options: because sometimes the market just wants to be dramatic.”
- Role-play script starter: “Imagine you’re selling a 60‑second option. Say: ‘It’s like betting on whether the sun will be polite today.’”

### Module 4 Chart Porn and Pattern Worship Lesson Script and Slides

#### Objective

Lampoon pattern-chasing and backtesting while teaching basic chart literacy and skepticism.

#### Spoken Script

“Charts are beautiful and dangerous. People see a candlestick and read a horoscope. Today we’ll learn one useful thing and one ridiculous thing. Useful: how to read a support line. Ridiculous: how to name a pattern so it sounds scientific. Example: ‘The Phoenix Reversal’ — it sounds credible and is probably made up.”

#### Sample Slide 5

**Title**: Candlesticks and Constellations
**Bullets**: Read a support line; Backtest last Tuesday; Name a pattern

#### Slide Notes and Joke Prompts

- Exact joke: “If a chart looks like a roller coaster, you should probably check if you’re on a theme park website.”
- Backtest exercise: “Find a pattern that worked last Tuesday and call it ‘statistically poetic.’”

### Module 5 Funnels Funnels Funnels Lesson Script and Slides

#### Objective

Show how webinars, tripwires, and upsells are layered persuasion; students build a satirical funnel.

#### Spoken Script

“A funnel is a polite way to say ‘we will ask you for money in stages until you say yes.’ Today you’ll write a webinar headline, a tripwire offer, and an upsell that sells the idea of buying more training about buying training. Example headline: ‘How I Turned $50 into a Story.’ That’s honest and theatrical.”

#### Sample Slide 6

**Title**: Webinar to Upsell Funnel
**Bullets**: Webinar headline; Tripwire product; Upsell script

#### Slide Notes and Joke Prompts

- Exact joke: “Tripwire: the thing you buy to prove you’re committed to buying things.”
- Copy prompt: “Write a 10-word webinar hook that sounds urgent and slightly theatrical.”

### Module 6 Risk Reversal and Refund Theater Lesson Script and Slides

#### Objective

Expose refund language and teach ethical alternatives; practice writing an honest refund policy.

#### Spoken Script

“Guarantees are theater. ‘Double-your-money’ promises are stage directions. We’ll practice two scripts: one for denying a refund politely and one for writing a refund policy that actually helps people. The honest policy is short and boring. The dishonest policy is long and theatrical. Guess which one sells more courses.”

#### Sample Slide 7

**Title**: Guarantees and Honest Refunds
**Bullets**: Refund scripts; Write an honest policy; Refund haiku challenge

#### Slide Notes and Joke Prompts

- Exact joke: “Our guarantee reads: ‘If you don’t laugh, we’ll refund you after you write a haiku about candlesticks.’ It’s satire and also a quality control filter.”
- Assignment: Draft a one-paragraph refund policy that prioritizes student outcomes.

### Module 7 Graduation Capstone Lesson Script and Slides

#### Objective

Students assemble a mock funnel that intentionally uses the techniques learned, then deconstruct it to reveal ethical pitfalls.

#### Spoken Script

“For your capstone, build a funnel that would make a cartoon villain proud. Then we’ll take it apart and label every persuasion lever you used. The goal is not to deploy it; the goal is to be able to recognize it in the wild and decide whether to use it responsibly. Graduation includes a printable certificate that says ‘Certified in Confident Speculation’ and a moment of reflection.”

#### Sample Slide 8

**Title**: Capstone and Deconstruction
**Bullets**: Build a mock funnel; Label the triggers used; Write a responsible alternative

#### Slide Notes and Joke Prompts

- Exact joke: “Your funnel should include at least one countdown timer, one staged testimonial, and one punny badge.”
- Final reflection prompt: “List three ways you would change your funnel to make it honest.”

**Final Spoken Line**
“If you enjoyed this course, please consider donating to a financial literacy program. If you didn’t enjoy it, write the haiku anyway — we’ll read it at graduation and award you a badge for effort.”
