### Hero Pitch

**What this is**
A perfectly earnest-sounding, slightly ridiculous, deeply satirical online course that teaches the _marketing_ of get-rich-quick investing as much as the investing itself. It looks and reads like the real thing—countdown timers, testimonials, and a “limited seats” banner included—so you can laugh, learn the persuasion mechanics, and spot the tricks next time an ad promises a Lambo.

**Who this is for**

- People who have seen one too many late-night ads.
- Marketers who want to study persuasion in the wild.
- Anyone who enjoys a good parody and wants to learn how funnels are built.
- Financially literate humans who prefer their comedy with a refund policy.

**Fast Win**
Enroll and complete the onboarding quiz to instantly receive your free NFT badge: a static PNG that says **“Paper Hands Pro.”**

### Pricing and Options

| **Plan**       |                  **What’s Included** | **Why It’s Ridiculously Priced**                                     |
| -------------- | -----------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Starter**    | Modules 0–3; badge; community access | For the curious and the caffeinated                                  |
| **Pro**        |   All modules; templates; bonus pack | For the committed speculator and the pun enthusiast                  |
| **Mastermind** | All content; live Q&A; private group | For those who want to pay more to be told they’re on the right track |

**Anchoring Trick**
The Mastermind price is shown first so the Pro plan looks like a bargain. This is called the decoy effect and also called “marketing.”

**Payment Options**

- One-time payment or three monthly payments (because psychology says installments feel cheaper).
- Price may increase when the moon aligns.

### Testimonials

**“I turned $50 into a story.” — _Sam S._ (definitely a real person)**
**“The countdown timer made me feel important.” — _A. Buyer_**
**“I learned to sell the course about selling the course. Ten out of ten.” — _Case Study #3_**

All testimonials are staged for comedic effect and to demonstrate how social proof is manufactured.

### Risk Reversal

**14-Day Satire Guarantee**
If you don’t laugh, learn at least one persuasion trick, or feel mildly entertained within 14 days, we’ll offer you a full refund—provided you can explain in 200 words why the course failed to amuse you and include a haiku about candlesticks.

**Refund Theater**
We teach the scripts marketers use to deny refunds politely, then we show you how to write an honest refund policy that no marketer would use.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Is this real trading advice**
No. This is satire and marketing analysis disguised as a trading course. Do not quit your job based on a badge.

**Will I actually make money**
Maybe you’ll make a meme. Maybe you’ll learn to spot manipulative funnels. Both are valuable in different currencies.

**Are the testimonials real**
They are illustrative. They are also funny.

**Is the scarcity real**
Only as real as your willingness to believe a flashing banner.

### Final Pitch

**Why enroll**
This course is a mirror held up to the world of late-night crypto and binary options marketing. It teaches the _how_ of persuasion by doing the _how_—then pulling the curtain back so you can see the strings. You will leave better at spotting urgency, decoding social proof, and resisting offers that sound too good to be true. You may also leave with a printable certificate and a new favorite pun.

**Call to Action**
**Enroll now** and get your free “Paper Hands Pro” badge. Doors close when the market corrects. Or at midnight. Same thing.
