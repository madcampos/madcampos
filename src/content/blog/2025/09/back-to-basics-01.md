I was invited to give a talk called "Battle of Frameworks", although I _use_ tools like react and angular for work, I am not personally _found_ of those tools so I decided to go with pure vanilla, gluten-free, non GMO, vegan, organic, home grown HTML, CSS, and javascript.

Don't get me wrong, those frameworks and tools get the work done, help pay the bills and usually I have no problems with them.

Besides, trying to build applications with the complexity I work day to day[^1] _without_ the help of those tools would be an herculean task that I'm not willing to take, nor are my employers willing to pay for.

Now thet the justification is done and hopefully I got the message that this doesn't come from a place of hatred, let's get into the why.

## The "why"

I think the "javascript fatigue" have caught on to me and I yearn for, not necessarily less _complex_, but "simpler" websites in terms of tooling and technologies used.

I want to showcase what the platform can do by itself, without needing extra tools, and do so using the proper language for the job instead of adding a neutron star in weight of javascript code to achieve things that are available, easier to use and much more manageable in HTML or CSS.

I think we end up so entrenched into the framework way of doing things that is hard to even think things would be possible to do otherwise, outside the walls and constraints of a specific tool or framework.

But enough yapping, let's get to what the project is about.

## The "what"

The demo project is an Italian restaurant website, with:
- A few pages, including a menu page, some recipes, and a nice "about us" page.
- A reservation form and a contact form. With validation.
- The website needs to be fast and snappy.
- Some SEO to make it even nicer.
- Ability to install as a PWA and work offline.
- Some interactivity and extra feature to the pages, enabled by javascript.

My initial idea was to make an Italian restaurant website. I guess I was hungry or craving some pasta at the time... So that's how I got the idea.

### The main colours

I wanted to move away from the stereotypical red, white, and green. So I did some research of other things that are associated with Italian culture and found some pictures of gorgeous ceramic tiles in beige and blue colours.

So that was my choice for colour palette:
- Royal blue as the primary colour.
- Dark golden yellow for the secondary colour.
- Beige for the main background.

### The pages

After some research[^3] I decided to go with the following general list of pages:
- Home page
- About page
- Table booking page
- Recipes page with 3 or 4 actual recipes
- Contact page

### The fonts

The vibe I wanted to have is of a modern place but with strong influences from tradition.

For that, a more cursive typeface for the headings and a serif typeface were chosen.

### The media

I think AI generates images have a "stale" feel to them, so I got all the images and videos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

To make them more "web friendly" I lowered the resolution and quality of the images and videos. It could be better optimized, but I didn't want to spend too much time experimenting, so some things may look worse quality than others.

## What now?

The next steps is building the project itself. That is done on the upcoming posts.

[^1]: For context, the kind of thing I usually have to deal with is going over lists of things and processing them. But those lists are usually 3~5 levels deeply nested, they represent multiple graphs with overlapping and interdependent relationships, and all of this data has to be drawn on the screen in a digestible and navigable manner for the people using the tools. It is a heck of a lot of work, but it is very niche and not your common "landing page + marketing funnel" type of website.

[^2]: Totally possible to add video game controller support to web pages. But it is a little clunky and a little bit annoying to get working.

[^3]: By "research" I mean googling "Italian restaurant website template" and checking what kinds of pages people had on their templates.
