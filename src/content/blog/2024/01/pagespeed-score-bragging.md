[Now this is a story all about how I got a perfect score and assets size down...](https://youtu.be/1nCqRmx3Dnw?si=QhtnwGRPyCN0u_rE) ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ¶

Okay, jokes aside, here is a _breakdown_ of how I got 100 in [PageSpeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/), [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/), and [AXE](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/chrome-browser-extension/). (And sorry I can't hold myself to a good pun)

## What are those tools?

The two first tools cited, PageSpeed and Lighthouse, are performance analyzers that check how fast and well your page loads. The third one, but no less important is an accessibility analyzer that reports issues with your page's accessibility.

## Why it is important?

One of the core principles of the web is being accessible to all. Even in places with really good internet connection we are constantly in situations where things do not work quite so perfectly.

To give a couple of very real examples on my day to day:
- When taking the subway I get spotty connection. It was only in the end of 2023 that mobile carriers started having service in Toronto's underground.
- When taking the elevator we are locked in a nice [Faraday cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage) so connections are effectively blocked.
- In my own home, when I'm at the office, the bathroom with all it's piping and water is between me and the Wi-Fi router. The connection can get bad if someone is showering.

It is interesting that even with super fast connection and cheap data plan we face the same struggles as people in less privileged situations. Being mindful and empathetic of people helps everyone.

## All about speed
