**⚠️ Trigger warning**: This post talks about disabilities, mental health and spoilers. If you are not comfortable with any of those topics, consider skipping this post.

There is this Brazilian short story called ["O alienista"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_alienista) (translated to English as "The Alienist" or "The Physician"). It is from one of the most acclaimed Brazilian authors, [Machado de Assis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machado_de_Assis) and it is part of the literary cannon, that boring thing we _have to read_ in high school.

The story is actually really good and easy to read, despite some words that are not used anymore. It tells the story of a doctor who opens a mental health institution in a small town and goes on a quest to find the universal cure for all mental issues.

I'm gonna spoil the plot here because it is relevant for this text, so beware and spoilers ahead!

The doctor starts admitting people to the facility, in the beginning all is good and the people going there have perceivable things going on. As time passes, he starts admitting people with even more nuanced and subtle "things", to the point where a whole chunk of the population is in the facility and the rest who is not starts to get worried they will be admitted there soon.

The story's underlying message is: everyone, at some point, will deviate from "normal".

## What is even normal?

Asking ourselves "what does normal _means_? What _is_ normal" is an interesting exercise to review our biases and privileges[^1]. 

If we think about it a little bit, everyone has a temporary disability at some point, everyone is striped from their privilege in some moments. We have to embrace those moments as opportunities to improve and better understand ourselves.

One problem of seeing myself as disabled is that it is considered a bad thing. Disabilities are socially unacceptable, we are seen as "less then" or "broken". On that context it is no wonder that people want to avoid the label.

It is so engrained in us that we should avoid being called disabled that it requires a lot of effort to accept it and eventually embrace it.

I dare to say that it was harder to accept and understand than accepting my sexuality. After all wearing glasses is socially acceptable and even a sign of "intelligence", and I like to read a lot so I've been "faking 'til I make it" on the dyslexia side. So, yeah... It was more subtle than holding hands with another man.

## No takesies-backsies

I feel like another coming out moment, and there is no return from that. Which is a good thing!

It is important to take our labels and be proud of them, to fight for them as good parts of who we are. This opens ourselves up to be more emphatic to similar people and find commonality with other groups and minorities.

Empathy and paying attention to what others say, then reflecting on what we perceive is the best exercise to improve, to make the world a better place by making us better.

The exception to that is bigots and fascists, those deserve a punch in the guts, from me and from everyone who can't punch a fascist.

[^1]: People sometimes say "you are getting political with that". Let me break it to you: _everything we do_ is political, whether we like it or not. It is only made _explicit_ here.
