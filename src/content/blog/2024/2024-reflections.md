This is the result of a thinking moment during the best times to think: while washing my hair.

I don't know, maybe the head massage when cleaning the scalp helps to make thoughts flow, or it is the sound of the water running that is very similar to white noise.

In any case, I was thinking of how this year have been and decided to write about it.

## Introspection

It was an interesting year from a career perspective as I switched jobs in the beginning of 2024 and that switch was interesting.

Previously I've been working with backend, so my mind was full of database normalizations, APIs, and other server goodies. Now it was full of CSS, props, and semantic HTML. To be honest, I've always worked with the whole full stack spectrum, and front-end is not alien to me, at all (see previous posts and all of my [Codepen](https://codepen.io/madcampos) portfolio).

But it has been a while since I've worked with front-end in a _work_ settings. Since the "before times" (pre-pandemic). Anyways, that was a welcoming change and I do like working with that, so cheers to work!

I think the most interesting part, and the reason I brought work up on my personal blog, is: this year was the first time I've "ended" a project.

With that I mean, I've seen a project be officially called "finished" and go into "maintenance only". Before that and interestingly enough, all projects I've worked with outlived my time working with them.

So this was a new experience, to learn to say farewell to something that I've invested on. It was a nice feeling of pride to have achieved something, to have built a good product, but also a realization that things come to an end.

## The cyclical nature of life

Putting an end to things makes me remember how everything finishes and we have to ask ourselves "now what?"

It ties to an anxiety that I had before moving to Canada. My plan for so many years was to move from Brazil. At the time I have invested so much time and resources to see this plan come through that when everything was sorted out, I had my tickets ready, I had a place to stay, I was working! The only part left to do was actually fly to a new home.

This left me with a feeling of accomplishment but also a feat of a "now what?" moment. Now that my long lasting dream had come true, what would I do next?

When the moment came, I felt relief but also had so many other things in my mind that were already there, that it was just a matter of picking something up and doing that. Life doesn't end, but cycles do. Or as best said by the opening song of the Lion King: it's the circle of life.

On the work side, one project ended, another started, as simple as that. And starting a new project is very exciting. So I think this year could be best described as "exciting"!

## Wins of 2024

Moving the introspection to something more concrete, I remember a long long time ago, when I had to put together some sample projects for my resume and impostor syndrome kicked in: I felt I didn't have good enough projects, but I did some interesting things. At that point I realized I should be proud of every little thing that was cool, even if it was not the best, _doing something_ is still an achievement in itself.

So here is my incomplete list of wins for 2024:

- I started learning how to knit.
- I contributed to some open source projects.
- Along with friends, I put together a [blog for Toronto JS](https://blog.torontojs.com).
- I assumed the role of project manager for the Toronto JS' Volunteer Management System (VMS).
- I've improved my website and blog, including a theme manager and some easter eggs.
- I've relearned Angular after not working with it for years.
- I've built some cool Lego things.
- I'm keeping my workout routine.

## TODO list

It is interesting how we have this feeling that "starting a new year" will just reset everything when in fact it is just a continuation of the things before.

Here is a non exhaustive list of things to do in the coming year:

- Continue with the workout routine.
- Build newer and cooler things with Legos.
- Finally learn how to ice skate better.
- Deliver some milestones for the Toronto JS VMS.
- Add more quirky stuff to this website.
- Finish a knitting project.
- Continue working and learning new things.

## _Carpe diem_

I don't know what the future holds, but found out before that worrying about the future is not worth it. So, as best said by an old Roman poet: _carpe diem_.
