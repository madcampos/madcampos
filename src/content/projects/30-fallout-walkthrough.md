A re-format of the incredible "Nearly Ultimate guide for Fallout 2" by Per Jorner ([archived version here](https://web.archive.org/web/20171116020222/https://user.tninet.se/~jyg699a/fallout2.html)). It also contains all the addition from the ["Fallout 2 Restoration Project"](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Restoration_Project) mod originally by Killap.

This project is a study on long, text heavy pages and how to semantically format them. It also provides nice visuals and small quality of life improvements for playing and completing the game.

Some of the features are: saving the completed quests, table of contents navigation, and icons for all the items.
