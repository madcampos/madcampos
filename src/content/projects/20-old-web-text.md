The project is a small tool to map text to other "writings" much like old text generators from the early 2000's era.

It is a study on how to work with strings in JavaScript. Topics includes string spliting, normalization, handling of accented characters, and emoji.

Most of the work are inspired by the articles [Unicode strings in JavaScript](https://2ality.com/2013/09/javascript-unicode.html) by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer and [JavaScript has a Unicode problem](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-unicode) by Mathias Bynens.
