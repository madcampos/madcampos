An intermediary level quick talk about Web Components, starting with a basic example on how they work, then describing how to integrate them with forms and add accessibility.

The starting point is the motivation on _why_ web components are useful and we should use them. The main argument is reducing complexity and dependencies.

Then there is a description on the building blocks of a web component and how accessibility, forms and advanced features work with them.

The main part of the presentation is a demo of a game interface with tabs, inputs and other native browser features.

Finally a quick list of shortcomings and hurdles on using web components.
