The tent flaps opened with a sound. For a second, the kid stood there, waiting for a permission to come in, waiting for approval.

"Yes?", said Ayla without turning her head from the desk to look at the kid.
"General, we are waiting your orders for what to do with the prisoners..."

She slowly turned to the kid, her head full of thoughts in the last few days, and in a monotone said "Let me take a look at them."

Her tired but sure feet moving through the camp to the tent where the prisoners were held. Aside from a slight greyness to the spots in her fur, one could not say she was getting old, her posture kept the same, her viciousness as a fighter could be said only grew stronger, but something felt different.

When she arrived at the tent three drow were tied to a pole in the center of the tent, their eyes covered and mouths gagged. Two guards stand there keeping watch of the miserable prisoners.

She approached one of the prisoners and removed his gag. His thin face reacted trying to move away and he cried unintelligible words, all she could understand was the despair in his voice. With a light touch as if caressing her loved child she held the prisoner's mouth shut, he now mumbling with more desperation under the soft but strong grasp. With a swift and precise move his jaw was broken and fell open, limp. Along came a guttural screech of pain.

Ayla's face remained unchanged and apathetic, her mind drifting away on something else, was it all those years fighting? Was it the weight of being the rebel leader? Was it the unrelenting and ungiving oppression the drow still exerted on the Underdark people? Maybe was the realization of how all those combined were Sisyphean tasks after all.

As if inundated by a wave of calm when the prisoner stopped twitching and passed out she was carried back to the present situation. With a sigh, she said to the kid "Rykker, cut their big toes, that will make 'em slow and unable to run, then release them away from the camp."

The kid, Rykker, had a quick glimpse of fear in his eyes, but his response was confident, or at least tried to sound like that. "Yes, moth... general!"

Ayla stood up, walked to the kid and put her hand in his shoulder, the kid was a strong leonin, but still looked tiny compared to his mother. "You are ready for this responsibility, I know it.", she said, patted Rykker's shoulder, and then stepped outside the tent.

As if the air inside the tent was heavy, tainted with the realization of everything that lead to this moment, she took a deep breath. Ten years have passed, she was now a mother, and also a leader that this small army depended on!

Even after all those years, Ayla still felt the yearning for adventuring from time to time, for storming a fortress, for searching for relics, fighting purple worms, been swallowed multiple times. Truth be told, she even missed Se Tara's bubbly personality a little bit. But now she had responsibilities though and could not simply _leave_, could she?

It is not like her trident hasn't tasted any blood, it has, a lot in fact. But those skirmishes started to feel repetitive, like a loop going over and over and over without end and perspective for a _change_... The thought made her throat tightens, her chest feel heavy.

She _wanted_ more. She _needed_ more!
