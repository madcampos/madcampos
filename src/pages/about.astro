			<p>
				Hey! Name is <strong>Marco</strong>, best known online by the moniker &ldquo;<em>madcampos</em>&rdquo;.
			</p>
			<p>I work as a programmer and like to build things, be it digitally with websites or physically with Legos, crochet, or cardboard.</p>
			<p>
				I like challanges and interesting stuff to just create and have fun. To me some of the best ideas come from moments when we say
				<q>what if we did this...</q> or <q>wouldn't it be interesting to do that...?</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				Ah, yes, I do enjoy geeking about web standards as well, like reading proposals and talking about them. <em>don't</em> say the magic words <q>web components</q>
				near me or I'll talk non stop for hours.
			</p>
			<p>Lastly, here is a picture of me:</p>
