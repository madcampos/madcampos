	<p>This site is made for people. As such I try my best to be AA compliant with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> and by doing that try to make the web more accessible and inclusive.</p>

	<p>That said, I'm not perfect and I'm always learning and improving the website.</p>
	<p>I run automated testing for accessibility issues regularly, as well as testing on desktop and mobile browsers with different zoom levels.</p>

	<p>If you have any issues with the site, please contact me at <em><a href="mailto:me@madcampos.dev">me@madcampos.dev</a></em>.</p>

	<p>If you have the technical knowledge, feel free to open an issue <a href="https://github.com/madcampos/madcampos.github.io/issues/new">on GitHub</a>.</p>
