So, April 9th is [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.org/), and I decided to join this year.

## What the...

This is a cool festivity to showcase the power of the semantic web and how _content_ is the base of everything we do.

## Keeping it PG

One of the interesting perks of writing semantic HTML from the get go is that I didn't have to do much...

Here is a list of changed made to the website:

- Added missing `width` attribute to images and SVGs.
- Added missing defaults for hiding logo parts (read more about that in the previous post).
- Added a default `hidden` to the PWA update banner.
- Added a default `hidden` to the themes SVG previews as they depend on CSS variables.

## Back to the regular programming

One day is just too short... So I went a little wild and made the changes last for the full week where April 9th lands on.

Unfortunately, as the website is statically hosted, no transformation happens on the server, so there may be a flash of style that will be replaced by the _raw and naked HTML_ (pun intended).

I hope you enjoy it!
