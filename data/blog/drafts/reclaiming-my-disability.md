**⚠️ Trigger warning**: This post talks about disabilities, mental health and spoilers. If you are not comfortable with any of those topics, consider skipping this post.

There is this Brazilian short story called ["O alienista"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_alienista) (translated to English as "The Alienist" or "The Physician"). It is from one of the most acclaimed Brazilian authors, [Machado de Assis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machado_de_Assis) and it is part of the literary cannon, that boring thing we _have to read_ in high school.

The story is actually really good and easy to read, despite being written in 1882! _Like, more than 100 years ago, like, wild!_

It tells the story of a doctor who opens a mental health institution in a small town and goes on a quest to find an universal cure for )_all_ mental health issues.

I'm gonna spoil the plot here because it is relevant for this text, so beware and spoilers below!

  The doctor starts admitting people to the facility, in the beginning all is good and the people going there have perceivable things going on. As time passes, he starts admitting people with even more nuanced and subtle "things", to the point where a whole chunk of the population is in the facility and the rest who is not starts to get worried they will be admitted there soon.

The story's underlying message is: everyone, at some point, will deviate from "normality".

## What is even normal?

Asking ourselves "what does normal _means_? What _is_ normal" is an interesting exercise to review our biases and privileges[^1].

If we think about it a little bit, everyone has a temporary disability at some point, everyone is striped from their privilege in some moments. We have to embrace those moments as opportunities to improve and better understand ourselves.

## [It's a Sin, by the Pet Shop Boys](https://youtu.be/dRHetRTOD1Q?si=ueQfq8pfbXjEWxIc)

One problem of seeing myself as disabled is that it is considered a bad thing. Disabilities are socially unacceptable, people are seen as "less then", "broken", or "needing the goodwill of others". With that context it is no wonder that people want to avoid the label!

It is so engrained and pervasive in us the thought of being "normal" that we fight to move away from the disabled label, even worse, taking pride of it.

I dare to say that the "disabled" label is harder to accept and understand than perceive and embracing my sexuality (but let's leave [intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality) for another post).

After all, wearing glasses is socially acceptable and even a sign of "intelligence". I also like to read so the "fake 'til I make it" mantra works on the dyslexia side as I use big words quite freequently.

So, yeah... Perceiving my glasses and dyslexia as disabilities is surprisingly more subtle than _marrying another man_.

## No takesies-backsies

It feels as another coming out moment, and there is no return from that. Once things are out they are out, no take back!

For me it is important that we all take our labels and be proud of them, to fight for them as good parts of who we are. This opens ourselves up to be more emphatic to similar people and find commonality with other groups and minorities.

Empathy and paying attention to what others say, then reflecting on what we perceive is the best exercise to improve, to make the world a better place by making us better.

The exception to that is bigots and fascists, those deserve a punch in the guts, from me and from everyone who can't punch a fascist.

[^1]: People sometimes say "you are getting political with that". Let me break it to you: _everything we do_ is political, whether we like it or not. It is only made _explicit_ here.
